## Personal Portfolio Section

### All
My portfolio isn't a list of achievements - it's an insight into me as a person, my skills & what drives me forward. Each section contributes to the wider picture of how I operate.

Click the heading to navigate through each topic.

### Technology
I've always been an analytical person. When I was a child, I turnned this style of thinking to math & chess. As a teenager, my focus shifted towards computer science which I studied with innovation at university. 

I've worked with a variety on technologies across different programming paradigms but my specialisms are cyber security & data visualisation.

Through experience, I've realised that analytical thought and logic isn't enough. This is where the philosphies of human-centred design started to influence my work with technology.

### Behavioural Science
I'm a people watcher (but not in the creepy way). I'm really interested in how we all think, feel & behave and how that can be influenced. 

I've spent a lot of time trying different interventions with myself to help me form desired routines & then habits - now I am explorig how I can help others do the same.

### Entrepereneurship
I've been interested in entrepreneurship since studying for my A-levels. Enterprise can solve a lot of problems sustainably, when it's done right.

When businesses are purpose-driven they look to have real positive impact on their employees, customers, the wider community and the planet. They use profit for greater impact, instead of increasing wealth inequality.

With entrepreneurship, I am developing my skills in leadership. In each of my roles, I look for opportunity to lead whilst learning from those that lead me.

### Purpose
Intrinsic motivation & purpose is a massive part of my life. It affects my choices in business, in my personal life, my relationships & in setting myself challenges.

Business can be a force for good. Technology can help us personalise support for lots of people. And behavioural science can make that support effective.

Outside of mental fitness, I find purpose in nature & testing my limits (mostly through some form of hiking or climbing).
