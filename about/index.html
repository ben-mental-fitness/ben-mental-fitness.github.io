        <h1>Ben Wainwright</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ben - co-founder of <a href="https://www.remapmentalfitness.com" target="_blank">Remap Mental Fitness</a> and enthusiast in all things behavioural science, technology and fun facts (did you know over 80% of people in Kenya use mobile money?).</p>
        <p>At Remap, we teach mental fitness routines ðŸ§ - specialising in a technique called visualisation aka mental rehearsal.</p>
        <p>Visualisation has been used for decades by athletes to gain a competitive edge. We teach you how to train your brain to improve the way you think, feel and perform across any area of your life.</p>  
        <p>We deliver workshops to organisations alongside events that anyone can get involved in. <a href="https://www.remapmentalfitness.com/contact" target="_blank">Get in touch</a> if you want to find out more! ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p><b>Why do I love teaching mental fitness?</b> In secondary school, I experienced social anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder and other mental health issues that negatively impacted every area of my life.</p>
        <p>But here's the thing, just as our mind can negatively impact our life - it can be trained to positively impact our life as well. ðŸ’ª</p>
        <p>It took me years of trial and error to become mentally healthy. Now, with the technique of visualisation, I am building and improving my mental fitness. And I want to share this skill with as many people as I can!</p>
        <p><b>Send me a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-mental-fitness/" target="_blank">message on LinkedIn</a> if you'd like to chat ðŸ™‚</b></p>

      <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 topic_text">
        <p>Over my four years studying innovation at the University of Bristol, I developed my human-centred design skillset. Through project based learning, I was able to get hands on experience in human-centred design alongside studying the theories behind it.<br/><br/>

        I've worked on projects about recycling, transportation, community engagement, cyber security and wellness. With each project I was able to learn from my mistakes, develop my skills and solve new problems.<br/><br/>

        Human-centred design is a philosphy that influences all of my work. With everything that I do, I am thinking about how key stakeholders are affected by the decisions I make.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 topic_text" id="hcd_text">
        <p> From a young age, I have thought analytically which proved useful for being good at things like math or chess as a child. During secondary school, I learnt that I could apply this ability to the discipline of computer science where logic and problem solving dominate. I then went on to study Computer Science with Innovation at university.<br/><br/>

        At university, and through work experience, I learnt a range to work with a range and technologies to solve a range of problems. However, I started to realise that analytical thought and logic wasn't enough - more was needed. This is where the philosphies of human-centred design started to influence my work with technology.<br/><br/>

        Whether I'm conducting deep research that very few people will see or developing a project for lots of people, I consider the benefits of such work. There's a lot of interest in 'cutting-edge' technology, yet so much more can be done with the existing technology we have. Applying existing technology to new domains is what excites me and where a lot of opportunity lies.</p>

        <p>I've been interested in entrepreneurship since studying for my A-levels. Enterprise can solve a lot of problems sustainably, when it's done right.<br/><br/>

        When businesses are purpose-driven they look to have real positive impact on their employees, customers, the wider community and the planet. They use profit for greater impact, instead of increasing wealth inequality.<br/><br/>

        With entrepreneurship, I am developing my skills in leadership. In each of my roles, I look for opportunity to lead whilst learning from those that lead me.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 topic_text" id="hcd_text">
        <p>Related to my fondness of purpose-driven business, I believe in the concept of charity and giving. Charities can play a crucial role in purpose-driven business, enabling multiple businesses to pool their resource in support of a single cause.<br/><br/>

        I raise money for charity about once a year, usually through completing a phsyical challenge. I've completed 10km runs, half marathons, Tough Mudders and even climbed a mountain (using the stairs in my home during the pandemic).</p>
